Script that serves as an example of how Redux and Redux Persist work.
Second most important feature of react native.
Redux is a tool that helps us to share data between screens.


1) install redux and the redux and react integration library.

With redux we can centralize the information in a 'box' (Provider) that will be independent of the screen, which I can access from any screen in the application.


2) install redux-persist and @react-native-community/async-storage

Combination of two libraries for even closing the app, the info remains saved.
Save reducer information to async-storage.
